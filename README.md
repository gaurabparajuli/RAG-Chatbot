# RAG-Chatbot

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using a vector database for semantic search and a MySQL database to store chat history. The chatbot is served via a Flask API.

## üöÄ Features

    1. Utilizes ChromaDB for efficient vector-based retrieval.
    2. Uses SentenceTransformer for text embeddings.
    3. Stores chat history in MySQL.
    4. Provides RESTful API endpoints for interaction.

## üõ† Installation

### üîß Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

    1. Python 3.10+

    2. MySQL Server

    3. Docker (optional for MySQL setup)

    4. pip and virtual environment tools

## üõ† Setting Up the Project from Scratch
If you don't want to clone the repository and prefer to build it from scratch, follow these steps:

1. Create a new directory for your project
    ```mkdir rag-chatbot && cd rag-chatbot```
2. Initialize a Python virtual environment:
```bash 
python -m venv venv 
venv\Scripts\activate
```
3. Install required dependencies:
```python
pip install flask chromadb langchain sentence-transformers mysql-connector-python ollama dotenv
```
4. Create the necessary python files:
```python 
touch embeddings.py database.py model.py routes.py app.py
```
5. Setup the .txt file with sample text data
```bash 
echo "Sample text for embeddings." > data.txt
``` 
6. Setup up the environment variables: Create a ```.env``` file and add your MySQL credentials:
```bash
echo "MYSQL_pass=your_mysql_password" > .env
```
## üõ† Setting Up MySQL
### üöÄ Start MySQL Server
If MySQL is not installed, you can install it from the following link:
[Download MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

### üìå Create Database & Table
Login to MySQL:
``` mysql -u root -p ```
Run the following SQL commands:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE chat_history;
USE chat_history;
CREATE TABLE chat(
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    role VARCHAR(10),
    content TEXT
);
```
## üöÄ Running the Chatbot
### üìù Store Text Embeddings in Vector Database
``` python embeddings.py ```
### üåê Start the Flask API
``` python app.py ```

    "answer": " Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by providing them with information from specific and relevant data sources. Essentially, it allows AI models to have conversations with data repositories, opening up new experiences and applications across various fields such as healthcare, finance, and more.",
    "retrieved_chunks": "How It Got Named ‚ÄòRAG‚Äô\n\nAnother great advantage of RAG is it‚Äôs relatively easy. A blog by Lewis and three of the paper‚Äôs coauthors said developers can implement the process with as few as five lines of code.\n\nThat makes the method faster and less expensive than retraining a model with additional datasets. And it lets users hot-swap new sources on the fly.\n\n‚ÄúWe always planned to have a nicer sounding name, but when it came time to write the paper, no one had a better idea,‚Äù said Lewis, who now leads a RAG team at AI startup Cohere.\nSo, What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)? \nRetrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information fetched from specific and relevant data sources.\n\nHow People Are Using RAG\nWith retrieval-augmented generation, users can essentially have conversations with data repositories, opening up new kinds of experiences. This means the applications for RAG could be multiple times the number of available datasets.\n\nFor example, a generative AI model supplemented with a medical index could be a great assistant for a doctor or nurse. Financial analysts would benefit from an assistant linked to market data.\n\ntext = \"\"\"What Is Retrieval-Augmented Generation, aka RAG?\nRetrieval-augmented generation is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with information from specific and relevant data sources.To understand the latest advancements in generative AI, imagine a courtroom."
